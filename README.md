# Leveraging Machine Learning to Explore the Role of Digital Finance in Enhancing Urban Economics  
## Project Description  
This project aims to analyze the impact of digital finance on urban economic development using machine learning techniques. Digital finance, encompassing technologies like mobile banking, digital wallets, and online payment systems, plays a crucial role in enabling financial inclusion and accelerating economic growth. Using a dataset containing diverse economic, financial, and demographic indicators, this project builds predictive models to uncover patterns and relationships that highlight the significance of digital finance in urban economies.  

### Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and scaling features to optimize input for machine learning models.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Developing unique, visually compelling analyses to reveal insights about financial, demographic, and economic relationships.  
3. **Machine Learning Modeling**: Employing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers to predict economic patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of each model.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare model performance and identify the most effective classifier.  
5. **Visualization**: Creating professional, insightful visualizations to communicate findings to stakeholders effectively.

  - F1-Score: 72% (Class 0), 61% (Class 1)  
  - Accuracy: **67.36%**  

### Random Forest Classifier Results  
- **Classification Report**:  
  - Precision: 91% (Class 0), 89% (Class 1)  
  - Recall: 91% (Class 0), 90% (Class 1)  
  - F1-Score: 91% (Class 0), 90% (Class 1)  
  - Accuracy: **90.24%**  

### XGBoost Classifier Results  
- **Classification Report**:  
  - Precision: 91% (Class 0), 89% (Class 1)  
  - Recall: 90% (Class 0), 89% (Class 1)  
  - F1-Score: 91% (Class 0), 89% (Class 1)  
  - Accuracy: **89.92%**  

The results indicate that **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (90.24%), closely followed by **XGBoost** (89.92%), while **Logistic Regression** performed relatively lower with an accuracy of 67.36%.
